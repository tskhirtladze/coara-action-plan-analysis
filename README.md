# Open Science Term Analysis (CoARA)

This repository houses data used in the study 'Advancing Open Science Through Research Assessment Reform? Content Analysis of CoARA Action Plans.

## Primary Content: Excel Datasets

It consists of three Excel data files in the 'Data_CoARA_Action_Plan_OS_Study' folder:

- Term_Binary_individual_terms.xlsx – Contains the binary term-level data indicating the presence/absence of individual open science terms.
- Term_Binary_with_individual_terms+Clusters.xlsx – Contains the binary term-level data for individual open science terms and thematic clusters.
- Term_Frequencies_Normalized_&_Raw.xlsx – Contains the raw and normalized term frequency data for individual open science terms.

**Note**
Two additional columns have been added to these Excel files containing the following metadata: Country and Type of Organisation.
- Primary source:  
  **[CoARA Signatories Dashboard](https://kfphcn9sd4noq5zjzqhgyr.streamlit.app/)**
- Where metadata was missing or unavailable via the dashboard, it was **added manually**
Term_Frequencies_Normalized_&_Raw.xlsx file also has a document wordcount column added.

These variables are **not generated by the script itself**


## What the Script Does

- Loads and processes all PDF files from a specified folder
- Extracts and cleans text using `pdftools`
- Removes predefined **CoARA boilerplate statements**
- Counts:
  - **Exact term frequencies**
  - **Binary presence (0/1)** of each term
- Saves cleaned text files for each PDF
- Outputs CSV files with:
  - term frequency dataset
  - binary dataset (individual terms)
  - binary dataset of individual terms and thematic clusters
- Detects how many PDFs contain CoARA boilerplate language


## Output Files

The script generates the following files in the input folder:

- `*_cleaned.txt` – cleaned text for each PDF  
- `Term_Frequencies.csv` – term frequency dataset
- `Term_Binary.csv` – binary dataset (individual terms) 
- `Term_Binary_with_Clusters.csv` – binary dataset of individual terms and thematic clusters  


## Requirements

R packages used:
- `pdftools`
- `stringr`
- `dplyr`
- `purrr`
- `tools`

Install missing packages with:
```{r}
install.packages(c("pdftools", "stringr", "dplyr", "purrr"))
```

## Usage

Unzip CoARA_Original_Action_Plans.zip and set the path of the unzipped folder as the value of the folder_path variable in the script.

Run the R script in R or RStudio.

Review the outputs (cleaned text files, CSVs) in the same folder as the PDFs.
